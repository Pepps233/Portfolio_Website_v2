    <p>
        Hey! I'm a Computer Science student at Purdue University and an aspiring software engineer passionate about building technology that makes a real-world impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        I work across the stack with Java, Python, React.js, Spring Boot, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I care deeply about writing clean, maintainable code, implementing strong testing practices, and developing reliable tools that people can depend on. My approach: prototype quickly, iterate thoughtfully, and measure real-world results.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recent highlights include refining a model using LoRA, developing vision-based robot localization systems, programming high-accuracy autonomous sequences, and building machine learning models for accessibility projects such as real-time ASL translation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy reading research papers on large language models, exploring new areas of artificial intelligence, and attending tech-related events. Always learningâ€”and always excited to tackle meaningful technical challenges.
