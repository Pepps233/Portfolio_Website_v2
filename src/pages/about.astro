    <p>
        Hey! I'm a computer science student and aspiring software engineer who loves building impactful technology and creating solutions that make life easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        I work across the stack with Java, Python, Kotlin, Spring Boot, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I care deeply about clean, maintainable code, strong testing practices, and building tools that people can rely on. My approach: prototype fast, iterate thoughtfully, and measure real-world results.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recent highlights include leading a robotics team as captain and software lead, developing vision-based robot localization, programming autonomous sequences with high accuracy, and building machine learning models for accessibility projects like real-time ASL translation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy mentoring others, designing lesson plans for programming and STEM education, and contributing to open-source projects. Always learningâ€”and always excited to tackle meaningful technical challenges.
    </p>
