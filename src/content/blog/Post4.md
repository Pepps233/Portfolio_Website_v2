# Hack the Future: Developing Software for Nonprofit Organizations Around the World

Exciting news â€” after a competitive application and interview process, Iâ€™m thrilled to share that Iâ€™ve been accepted into **Hack the Future** at **Purdue University**!

The application phase consisted of two parts: a rÃ©sumÃ©-style background review, followed by a scheduled interview with one of the executive members. The interview process went smoothly â€” the interviewer was friendly and guided me through the conversation with patience. I was able to talk about my passion and past projects, which led to engaging back-and-forth discussions that helped me better understand **Hack the Futureâ€™s** mission and team structure.

Iâ€™d like to thank the **Hack the Future** team for organizing such an amazing experience and for running a well-structured interview process.

I canâ€™t wait to collaborate with brilliant peers, work on cutting-edge projects, and contribute to building the future of tech and innovation. ðŸš€
