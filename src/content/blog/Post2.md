# Memories Beyond the Scores: My Journey with Rambots FRC 2204

**Summary:**  
Reflecting on my time with Rambots FRC 2204, I realize the most unforgettable moments weren’t awards or exams, but the late nights spent building, laughing, and brainstorming with my amazing teammates.

After graduating high school, I would say that my most memorable experiences weren’t receiving the A grades I studied endlessly for, nor the satisfaction after taking the AP exams, nor the “big fun moments.” Instead, it was the **little moments I spent with my friends and classmates**, and most importantly, the time I spent with my **robotics team**.

This June, **Rambots FRC 2204** wrapped up an amazing season. I had the honor of serving as **Team Captain, Software Lead, and Driver**. During this past season, the team worked extremely hard to deliver a high-performance robot that carried our hopes of dominating on the playing field—which we did! Our robot contributed to us being **second-place regional finalists at the California Sacramento Regional** and **first-place regional winners at the California East Bay Regional**.

Some of the most memorable moments took place **after school until 9 PM**, where we would chat, snack, build the robot, debug, and brainstorm together. It was during these late-night meetings that unforgettable memories were made:
- Subteams would intensely brainstorm solutions, only to be interrupted by a sudden joke that made everyone laugh.
- Kind teammates would drive out to order milk tea for everyone.
- Late-night gaming sessions right after robotics meetings, which often turned into more robotics discussions.
- Always setting up the playing field in excitement to test the robot, and often cleaning it up in disappointment.

These small, shared experiences are what made the season truly special.

My sincere thanks to **Rambots 2204**, and my congratulations to every team member! I hope you all continue to **compete and excel in the upcoming seasons**.
